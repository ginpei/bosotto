### Project Initialization #setup #init

#### Planning and Implementation
- Created Hono project using `npm create hono@latest` (nodejs template)
- Initialized Git repository
- Confirmed basic project structure

#### AI Context
- **Framework Selection**: Chose Hono for its lightweight nature and excellent TypeScript support
- **Project Structure**: 
  - `src/client/` - Frontend (React)
  - `src/server/` - Backend (Hono)
- **Related Files**: 
  - [`package.json`](./package.json) - Dependency management
  - [`tsconfig.json`](./tsconfig.json) - TypeScript configuration

### Planning #planning

#### Functional Requirements
- Create a Twitter-like notepad application
- Posts are arranged in chronological order
- Data is stored on the client side (browser)

#### Technology Stack
- Using TypeScript (strict type checking)
- React + Tailwind CSS for UI implementation
- Prettier for code formatting

#### AI Context
- **Client-side Storage**: Decision to use localStorage instead of a server-side database
- **TypeScript**: Adopted strict settings to ensure type safety
- **UI Design Approach**: Prioritizing a simple and user-friendly interface

### Implementation #implementation

#### Setting Up Dependencies
- Installed React, React DOM, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Prettier, and other dependencies
```bash
npm install react react-dom
npm install -D @vitejs/plugin-react tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite prettier
```

#### Organizing Project Structure
- Organized project structure (client/server directories)
- Configured Vite
- Set up Tailwind CSS
- Updated TypeScript configuration
- Implemented basic React components
- Configured Hono server
- Set up Prettier
- Made initial commit

#### AI Context
- **Directory Structure**: Clearly separated client and server to achieve separation of concerns
- **Build Tool**: Selected Vite for its fast development experience and HMR support
- **Code Conventions**: Using Prettier to maintain consistent code style
- **Related Files**:
  - [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) - Server entry point
  - [`src/client/index.tsx`](./src/client/index.tsx) - Client entry point
  - [`vite.config.ts`](./vite.config.ts) - Vite configuration

### Testing #testing

#### Functional Testing
- Started Vite development server
- Verified UI display
- Tested posting functionality (creating and deleting posts)
- Confirmed data persistence using localStorage

#### AI Context
- **Testing Method**: Conducted manual testing, automated testing is a future task
- **Verification Points**: UI display, data persistence, basic CRUD operations

### Timeline Page Migration #refactor #routing

#### Planning
- Moved timeline page from `/` to `/tl/`
- Changed structure from SPA to having independent entry points for each page
- Separated page-specific components from common components

#### Implementation
- Created new directory structure
  - `src/client/pages/home/` - For home page
  - `src/client/pages/tl/` - For timeline page
  - `src/client/shared/` - For shared components
- Moved content from current `App.tsx` to `TimelinePage.tsx`
- Created new home page component `HomePage.tsx`
- Created entry points for each page
- Updated Vite configuration to support multiple entry points
- Updated server-side configuration to handle new routes
- Added `dist/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent build artifacts from being included in the repository

#### Decisions
- Kept UI unchanged, only modified file structure and routing
- Placed page-specific components in `components/` within each page directory
- Placed common components in the `shared/` directory

#### AI Context
- **Architecture Change**: Reason for migrating from SPA to MPA was to increase independence of each page
- **Component Design**: Clearly separated reusable components from page-specific components
- **Build Optimization**: Generating independent bundles for each page to improve initial load time
- **Related Files**:
  - [`src/client/pages/tl/TimelinePage.tsx`](./src/client/pages/tl/TimelinePage.tsx) - Timeline page component
  - [`src/client/pages/home/HomePage.tsx`](./src/client/pages/home/HomePage.tsx) - Home page component
  - [`vite.config.ts`](./vite.config.ts) - Multi-page configuration

### Development Script Improvements #devops

#### Planning
- Enable simultaneous launching of server and client development servers
- Organize existing scripts to make them more user-friendly

#### Implementation
- Installed `concurrently` package
```bash
npm install -D concurrently
```
- Updated scripts in package.json
  - Renamed existing `dev` script to `dev:server`
  - Added new `dev` script to run `dev:server` and `dev:client` simultaneously

#### Decisions
- Use `npm run dev` to start both servers simultaneously
- Use `npm run dev:server` or `npm run dev:client` to start them individually
- Used concurrently's color-coding feature to make output more readable

#### AI Context
- **Development Experience Improvement**: Eliminated the need to manually run multiple commands, improving development efficiency
- **Parallel Processing**: Using concurrently to efficiently manage multiple processes
- **Related Files**:
  - [`package.json`](./package.json) - Script configuration
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:server\" \"npm run dev:client\" --names \"server,client\" --prefix-colors \"blue,green\"",
    "dev:server": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
    "dev:client": "vite"
  }
}
```

### Development Script Optimization #devops #performance

#### Planning
- Modified `dev:client` command to only build files, removing web server functionality
- Avoided duplication since `dev:server` already provides a web server

#### Implementation
- Changed `dev:client` script in `package.json`
  - Before: `"dev:client": "vite"`
  - After: `"dev:client": "vite build --watch"`

#### Decisions
- `npm run dev:client` now watches for file changes and automatically builds them, but doesn't start a server
- `npm run dev:server` continues to run the Hono server and serve the built files
- `npm run dev` runs both simultaneously, so the development experience remains unchanged

#### AI Context
- **Resource Optimization**: Reduced resource usage by eliminating duplicate web servers
- **Build Process**: Achieved continuous building using watch mode while keeping server functionality separate
- **Related Files**:
  - [`package.json`](./package.json) - Updated script configuration
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:server\" \"npm run dev:client\" --names \"server,client\" --prefix-colors \"blue,green\"",
    "dev:server": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
    "dev:client": "vite build --watch"
  }
}
```

### AI Agent Documentation #documentation #ai

#### Planning
- Create documentation specifically for AI agents working with the project
- Organize instructions, project context, and contribution guidelines
- Store documentation in a dedicated directory for easy access and maintenance

#### Implementation
- Created `.ai/` directory to store AI agent documentation
- Created the following documentation files:
  - `.ai/instructions.md` - Communication style and task handling instructions
  - `.ai/project-context.md` - Project overview and architecture
  - `.ai/guidelines.md` - Contribution guidelines and development practices
  - `.ai/README.md` - Documentation overview and usage instructions

#### Decisions
- Used Markdown format for all documentation for readability and compatibility
- Organized documentation into separate files by purpose
- Included detailed information about Zundamon communication style
- Provided comprehensive project context to reduce the need for AI agents to scan all files
- Added clear contribution guidelines to maintain code quality and consistency

#### AI Context
- **Documentation Purpose**: Created to improve efficiency of AI agent interactions and ensure consistent communication style
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Documented project understanding to avoid redundant analysis in future interactions
- **Communication Standards**: Established clear guidelines for Zundamon-style responses and language usage
- **Related Files**:
  - [`.ai/instructions.md`](./.ai/instructions.md) - AI agent instructions
  - [`.ai/project-context.md`](./.ai/project-context.md) - Project structure documentation
  - [`.ai/guidelines.md`](./.ai/guidelines.md) - Contribution guidelines
